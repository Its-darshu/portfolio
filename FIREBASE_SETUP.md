## 🔒 Important: Set Firestore Rules

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **portfolio-e3**
3. Click **Firestore Database** (left sidebar)
4. Click **Rules** tab
5. Replace with these rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /posts/{postId} {
      // Anyone can read posts
      allow read: if true;
      
      // Only allow writes (no authentication needed for now)
      // You can add authentication later
      allow write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

6. Click **Publish**

## 🔐 Security Note

Current setup allows anyone to write to Firestore (for simplicity). 

**For better security** (optional):
- Add Firebase Authentication
- Update rules to require auth
- I can help you set this up if needed!
